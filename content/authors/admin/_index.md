I'm a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science and Applied Mathematics at the Weizmann Institute of Science, where I'm advised by Prof. [Shahar Dobzinski](https://sites.google.com/site/dobzin/).
My primary research interests are algorithmic game theory, mechanism design,  and approximation algorithms.
